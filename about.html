<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hey, My Name is Daniel and I'm a Web Developer. Most of my work is trivial at the moment but I'm working hard to 
  learn more and more everyday. I belive in hard work and dedication are important in any and all things that I do. 
  Education has always been a hobby of mine, if I find it interesting, I will stop at nothing to learn what I can. 
  I'm really hoping to find a job as a Web Developer to practice and improve my skill to the best of my ability.</p>

<p>I find myself looking for activities that bring me outdoors or involve traveling. At this point I have never been
  Out of the United States but someday I hope to change that. As for now, camping and practicing survival techniques
  out in the woods or in the middle of the desert will have to do.</p>

<p>The absolute number one thing in my life is my three kids and my wife, without them I wouldn't know what to do with
  myself. My kids are 14,13,and 11. Two girls and one boy. My wife and I have been marrried for almost two years now. We
  live simple and we love it. Family is what it is all about for us. We enjoy swimming and barbaques with our parents and
  extended family as often as possible.</p>
